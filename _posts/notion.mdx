Now that the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com) is in beta, nothing could stop me anymore from trying it out. This quickly ended up in a weird experiment called [Notion Playgrounds](https://series.slice.so/playground).

Here's how I built it, using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Nightwind](https://github.com/jjranalli/nightwind) to automatically generate the dark mode.

## Interacting with Notion API

First of all, I created an api route to handle my Notion GET requests. In this case I was interested in retrieving the contents of a Notion page, so I needed the [Retrieve block children endpoint](https://developers.notion.com/reference/get-block-children).

I knew I wanted to build more than one page, so I built a [dynamic API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes) that accepts a **pageId** as the query parameter, and returns me the corresponding object from the Notion API.

```js
// api/notion/[pageId].ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { pageId } = req.query
  const endpointBlocks = `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/${pageId}/children`

  const fetcher = (url, options?) =>
    fetch(url, options).then((res) => res.json())

  const data = {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NOTION_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Notion-Version": "2021-05-13",
    },
  }

  const blocks = await fetcher(endpointBlocks, data)
  res.status(200).json({ blocks })
}
```

## Rendering the page & the swr magic ‚ú®

There were 3 things I wanted:

1. **Generate the pages statically**, to make everything lightning-fast and SEO friendly
2. **Have dynamic routes**, so I could have all pages under the paths _/playground/1_, _/playground/2_, etc.
3. **Fetching data from Notion in real-time**, with a [stale-while-revalidate pattern](https://swr.vercel.app/).

### Dynamic routes & Static Generation

[Static generation in Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) happens through the _getStaticPaths_ and _getStaticProps_ functions.

GetStaticPaths is used to get the actual paths of the page, while getStaticProps returns the props to each page ‚Äì in this case the **slug** and the **pageId** props.

```js
// pages/playground/[slug].tsx

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      {
        params: {
          slug: "1",
        },
      },
      {
        params: {
          slug: "2",
        },
      },
      {
        params: {
          slug: "3",
        },
      },
    ],
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const slug = context.params.slug
  const pageIdArray = [
    "38fc182c459340b294fca3c99b88faae",
    "9e569a521efc4f0fa2087de12fca5e81",
    "59a5889031314f73a2c1bd268a486dff",
  ]
  const pageId = pageIdArray[slug - 1]
  return {
    props: {
      slug,
      pageId,
    },
  }
}
```

### Rendering the data on page

Getting the data to display on website is trivial when using Nextjs and the (amazing) [SWR hook](https://swr.vercel.app).

I simply have to make an API call to the API route I built in the first step, using SWR and a fetcher function. This will return me the data to display on page, while caching and revalidating automatically.

```js
export default function Play({ slug, pageId }) {
  const fetcher = (url, options?) =>
    fetch(url, options).then((res) => res.json())

  const { data, error } = useSWR(`/api/notion/${pageId}`, fetcher)

  return (
    // Return page using data returned from the api
  )
}
```

At this point I just had to render what Notion was returning from my request.

In this case, that would be an array of [block objects](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block), each containing an array of [Rich text objects](https://developers.notion.com/reference/rich-text) containing the styling properties.

> Note: Some blocks appear to be unsupported at this time, and others have children blocks that would've needed to be retrieved recursively. I didn't build this feature yet, so I made sure such block returned either a line element or _null_.

```js
// ...
<div className="prose">
  {!error && data ? (
    data.blocks.results.map((line, key) => {
      if (line.paragraph) {
        return (
          <p key={key}>
            {line.paragraph.text.map((t, k) => {
              return <NotionSpan key={k} t={t} />
            })}
          </p>
        )
      } else if (line.heading_1) {
        return (
          <h1 key={key}>
            {line.heading_1.text.map((t, k) => {
              return <NotionSpan key={k} t={t} />
            })}
          </h1>
        )
      }
      // ... All elements that can be contained in the block objects
      else if (
        line.type === "unsupported" &&
        line.object === "block" &&
        !line.has_children
      ) {
        return <hr key={key} />
      } else {
        return null
      }
    })
  ) : (
    <p className="text-gray-500 text-center">Ready in 3, 2, 1...</p>
  )}
</div>
```

To handle text styling I wanted to leverage the amazing TailwindCSS palette while automatically build a dark mode with Nightwind.

So I made a **\<NotionSpan>** component which returns the text content of the Rich text object, wrapped in a **\<span>** element with styling applied depending on the properties of the Rich text object.

I don't have to think about styling the dark mode because [Nightwind does it automatically for me](https://github.com/jjranalli/nightwind).

```js
import { FC } from "react"

export interface NotionSpanProps {
  t: any;
}

const colors = {
  text: {
    gray: "text-gray-600",
    brown: "text-amber-700",
    orange: "text-orange-600",
    yellow: "text-yellow-600",
    green: "text-green-600",
    blue: "text-blue-600",
    purple: "text-purple-500",
    pink: "text-pink-600",
    red: "text-red-500",
  },
  bg: {
    gray: "bg-gray-200",
    brown: "bg-amber-200",
    orange: "bg-orange-200",
    yellow: "bg-yellow-200",
    green: "bg-green-200",
    blue: "bg-blue-200",
    purple: "bg-purple-200",
    pink: "bg-pink-200",
    red: "bg-red-200",
  },
}

const NotionSpan: FC<NotionSpanProps> = ({ t }) => {
  return (
    <span
      className={`
      ${t.annotations.bold ? "font-bold " : ""}
      ${
        t.annotations.code
          ? "font-medium overflow-hidden shadow-md rounded-sm py-2.5 px-5 bg-gray-100 text-indigo-600"
          : ""
      }
      ${
        t.annotations.color !== "default"
          ? t.annotations.color.includes("background")
            ? `${colors.bg[t.annotations.color.split("_")[0]]} text-gray-900 `
            : colors.text[t.annotations.color]
          : ""
      }
      ${t.annotations.italic ? "italic " : ""}
      ${t.annotations.strikethrough ? "line-through " : ""}
      ${t.annotations.underline ? "underline " : ""}`}
    >
      {t.text.link ? (
        <a href={t.text.link.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          {t.text.content}
        </a>
      ) : (
        `${t.text.content}`
      )}
    </span>
  )
}

export default NotionSpan
```

### Wrapping up

And that's it! Notion API makes it really easy to get the data of a Notion page (and databases seem to be even more powerful, can't wait to try that too!), while Nextjs + swr spectacularly handle all the complex parts giving you the best possible experience.
